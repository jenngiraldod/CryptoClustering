# CryptoClustering
### Answer

Using fewer features for clustering with K-Means has several impacts:

1. **Improved Computational Efficiency**: Reducing the number of features decreases the dimensionality of the data, leading to faster computations and lower memory usage. K-Means scales poorly with high-dimensional data, so fewer features make it more efficient.

2. **Better Cluster Interpretability**: With fewer features, it becomes easier to understand and visualize the clusters. High-dimensional data can be challenging to interpret, while reducing features (e.g., using PCA) allows for clearer insights.

3. **Potential Loss of Important Information**: If relevant features are removed, the model may lose valuable information that differentiates clusters, leading to poor clustering performance and misclassification.

4. **Reduced Risk of the Curse of Dimensionality**: In high-dimensional spaces, data points tend to be equidistant from each other, making it difficult for K-Means to form meaningful clusters. Using fewer features mitigates this issue.

5. **Effect on Cluster Quality**: If dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA are used, the transformed features may capture the most variance, leading to well-defined clusters. However, if important distinguishing features are removed arbitrarily, the clustering may become less accurate.

In summary, using fewer features can improve efficiency and interpretability but may also reduce the quality of clustering if essential information is lost.
